The Outcome Engine

Constraint, Choice, and Income Dynamics in Human Systems

This project analyzes income as the emergent output of a human system rather than a standalone target to be predicted.

Using public census-style data, the analysis examines how structural constraints, leverage variables, and regime-dependent dynamics interact to shape economic outcomes.

Rather than asking “Can income be predicted?”, this project asks:

Where does effort compound—and where does the system cap outcomes regardless of intent?

Systems Framing

Variables are treated according to their role within the system:

	•	Constraints: hard or slow to change (age, education access)
	
	•	Leverage variables: adjustable within bounds (hours worked, capital gains)
	
	•	Gatekeepers: unlock or block entire outcome regions (occupation, education thresholds)

The same action can produce different results depending on starting conditions.

Methodology

	•	System ingestion and data normalization
	
	•	Exploratory analysis by constraint category
	
	•	Regime-based modeling
	
	•	Interpretable classification models
	
	•	SQL replication of core insights

Limitations

This analysis is descriptive, not causal.
It makes no claims about individual merit or responsibility.
It observes how systems behave under constraint.

Artifacts

	•	Jupyter notebooks documenting each analytical stage
	
	•	SQL scripts reproducing core findings
	
	•	Visualizations illustrating system dynamics
