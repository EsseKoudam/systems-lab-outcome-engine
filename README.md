THE OUTCOME ENGINE


A Systems Lab flagship project

This project models how demographic, educational, and economic constraints interact with individual choices to shape income outcomes.

Using public census-style data, I built an end-to-end analytical pipeline:

  Data ingestion and cleaning

  Exploratory data analysis

  Feature engineering

  Interpretable modeling

  Explainability and bias-aware evaluation

  SQL replication of core insights


KEY RESULTS

  Logistic Regression ROC AUC: 0.86 (approximate, varies by split)

  Strongest predictors of earning >50K:

  Education level

  Capital gains

  Hours worked per week

  Occupation category


WHY THIS MATTERS

Rather than treating income as purely random or purely merit-based, this project frames outcomes as system-level interactions between structure and agency.

The goal is not moral judgment, but understanding.


ARTIFACTS
